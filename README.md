# Password-Gen

Create an HTML file: Create an HTML file with a basic structure that includes an input field to specify the length of the password, checkboxes for different character types to include in the password, and a button to generate the password.

Write the JavaScript code: In your HTML file, create a script tag and write the JavaScript code to generate the password. The first step is to define an array for each character type you want to include in the password, such as lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Then, you can use a random number generator to select a random character from each array and concatenate them into a string until you reach the desired length of the password.

Add event listeners: Use JavaScript to add event listeners to the checkboxes and generate button so that the user's selections are captured and the password is generated when the button is clicked.

Display the password: Finally, use JavaScript to display the generated password in a text field or alert box so that the user can easily copy and use it.
